# Java Event Reminder Application

A simple, command-line-based Event Reminder application built with Java. This project was created to demonstrate a practical implementation of fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms for managing and scheduling events.

It provides a clean, straightforward console interface for users to manage their daily or upcoming events efficiently.

## ‚ú® Core Features

-   **Add Events**: Easily add new events with a name, date, and time.
-   **View All Events**: Display a complete list of all currently stored events.
-   **Search for an Event**: Quickly find a specific event by its name using a case-insensitive search.
-   **Delete an Event**: Remove events that are no longer needed.
-   **Interactive Menu**: A user-friendly menu to navigate through the application's features.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

This project emphasizes simplicity and clarity to showcase core programming concepts.

-   **Language**: **Java**
-   **Primary Data Structure**: **`ArrayList`**
    -   Chosen for its dynamic resizing capabilities, making it simple and efficient to manage a list of events without a predefined size.
-   **Core Algorithm**: **Linear Search**
    -   Implemented for the search and delete functionalities. It's a straightforward algorithm that works well for the scale of this application.
-   **Input/Output**: The application runs entirely in the console, using `java.util.Scanner` for user input.
